Abstract:

Stellar Stories: Space Weather Adventures is a web‑based interactive storytelling application developed to demonstrate how space weather phenomena affect different professions. The project combines narrative‑driven decision making with scientific concepts such as solar storms, geomagnetic disturbances, and radiation exposure. Users assume the roles of an Astronaut, Farmer, or Pilot, make choices at critical moments, and observe the consequences of their decisions.

1. Introduction:

Space weather events such as solar flares and geomagnetic storms have significant real‑world impacts on satellites, communication systems, aviation, and agriculture. The objective of this project is to present these impacts in an engaging and easily understandable manner through interactive storytelling. Instead of passive reading, users actively participate in scenarios, helping them better understand cause‑and‑effect relationships.

2. Objectives:

To create an interactive, choice‑based storytelling web application

To educate users about real‑world effects of space weather

To demonstrate frontend–backend integration using Flask

To design a clean and user‑friendly interface

To implement decision logic and branching outcomes

3. Features:

Character‑based story selection

Scenario‑driven narratives with multiple choices

Dynamic outcomes based on user decisions

REST‑style API for handling story progression

Responsive and visually appealing space‑themed UI

4. Characters and Scenarios:

4.1 Astronaut
